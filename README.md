# FoundationsTester

## Purpose
Well, we've reached the point in the semester where I'm bored but not feeling
productive enough.  Because of this, I've decided to write an automated tester
that allows for the quick and easy verification of one's foundations project
code.

## Usage Instructions
1. Copy your versions of the following files into FoundationsTester/ (where README.md is):
* Makefile
* Main.cpp
* SMClass.h
* SMClass.cpp
* globals.h
* globals.cpp
* SM.lex
* SM.yacc

2. Execute the testAll.sh bash script (i.e. ./testAll.sh ).

3. Verify your accepted and rejected line counts match the expected values.
